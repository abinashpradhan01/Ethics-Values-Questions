# Ethics and Values - Answers

## Long Questions

### 1. Real Education builds Character - Discuss
Real education extends far beyond the acquisition of academic knowledge and skills. It encompasses the holistic development of an individual, with character formation as a central component. Real education nurtures critical thinking, ethical reasoning, empathy, and moral courage. It encourages learners to question assumptions, develop personal values, and take responsibility for their actions.

When education focuses solely on academic achievement or vocational training, it fails to address the fundamental aspects of character that determine how knowledge will be applied. Real education integrates intellectual development with moral and ethical development, helping students understand not just what to think, but how to think and act with integrity.

Through collaborative learning, community engagement, and ethical dilemmas, real education provides opportunities for students to develop virtues like honesty, responsibility, respect, and compassion. These character traits become integrated into their identity and guide their decisions throughout life, ultimately contributing to a more just and compassionate society.

Authentic success involves both achievement and fulfillment, contributing positively to one's community while developing one's unique potential.

### 17. Mention one defect of self-monitoring.
One significant defect of self-monitoring is the potential for self-deception or bias in self-assessment. Individuals often have limited objective awareness of their own behaviors, thoughts, or performance, leading to inaccurate self-evaluation.
